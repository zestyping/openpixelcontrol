"""A demo client for Open Pixel Control
http://github.com/zestyping/openpixelcontrol

Sends red, green, and blue to the first 3 LEDs.

To run:
First start the gl simulator using, for example, the included "wall" layout

    make
    bin/gl_server layouts/wall.json

Then run this script in another shell to send colors to the simulator
