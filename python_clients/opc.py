"""Python Client library for Open Pixel Control
http://github.com/zestyping/openpixelcontrol

Sends pixel values to an Open Pixel Control server to be displayed.
http://openpixelcontrol.org/

Recommended use:

    import opc

    # Create a client object
    client = opc.Client('localhost:7890')

    # Test if it can connect (optional)
    if client.can_connect():
        print 'connected to %s' % ADDRESS
    else:
        # We could exit here, but instead let's just print a warning
        # and then keep trying to send pixels in case the server
        # appears later
        print 'WARNING: could not connect to %s' % ADDRESS

    # Send pixels forever at 30 frames per second
    while True:
        my_pixels = [(255, 0, 0), (0, 255, 0), (0, 0, 255)]

            print '...'

        server_ip_port should be an ip:port or hostname:port as a single string.
        For example: '127.0.0.1:7890' or 'localhost:7890'

        There are two connection modes:
        * In long connection mode, we try to maintain a single long-lived
          connection to the server.  If that connection is lost we will try to
          create a new one whenever put_pixels is called.  This mode is best
          when there's high latency or very high framerates.
        * In short connection mode, we open a connection when it's needed and
          close it immediately after.  This means creating a connection for each
          call to put_pixels. Keeping the connection usually closed makes it
          possible for others to also connect to the server.

        A connection is not established during __init__.  To check if a
        connection will succeed, use can_connect().

        If verbose is True, the client will print debugging info to the console.
